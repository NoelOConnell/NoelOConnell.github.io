Recently while developing a NativeScript Android app, I wanted to create a card style ListView with a margin between each row to give it that material design look.
Since NativeScript uses <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling">CSS</a> for it's styling, I presumed adding margin to each item in the list would do the trick.
